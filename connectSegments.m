    % If a segment intersects itself, such as in the letter "O," it will end at
    % a point that is adjacent to another pixel in that segment. This will 
    % create a small gap when drawn on the whiteboard. To correct this, add the
    % final adjacent pixel to the end of that segment so the line is closed. 
    % This section of code looks at each segment, finds any self-intersections,
    % and closes them. p1 is the first point in a segment. pN is the last point
    % in the segment. Add any points near p1 to the beginning of the segment. 
    % Add any points near pN to the end of the segment.
